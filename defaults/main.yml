## The configuration below would get you a server ready to run
## d7_init.sh /srv/drupal-dev1 and d7_init.sh /srv/drupal-dev2
## the sites would then be accessible at:
## drupal-dev1.example.com and drupal-dev2.example.com
## the domain or subdomain where the sites you build will be accessed
## For this to be accessed by others, you need one of:
#  1) proper DNS entries
#  2) a service like ngrok
httpd_dn_suffix: 'example.com'
## Your email address
email: 'user@example.com'
## The hostnames of the sites you will build.
#sites: ['drupal-dev1', 'drupal-dev2']
## Let's encrypt cert paths
#httpd_cert_path: '/vagrant/letsencrypt/etc/live/'
#httpd_key_path: '/vagrant/letsencrypt/etc/live/'
## Self-signed cert paths
httpd_cert_path: '/etc/pki/tls/certs/'
httpd_key_path: '/etc/pki/tls/private/'
